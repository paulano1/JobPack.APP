    It is common knowledge that job applications have become a numbers game, and searching through hundreds of job boards is personally exhausting. Additionally, I've seen a trend where companies close job postings within a week or two. This motivated me to create a tool that notifies me as soon as a job is posted. This project is starting as a personal weekend project, but if others find it useful, I plan to dedicate more time to it and make it open-source.

    This is the alpha version of the app, so expect some bugs and incomplete features. We're currently limiting access to <strong>50</strong> users. I put this together in 24 hours, so your patience is appreciated. Upcoming features, prioritized as follows, include:

    <li><strong>Application Tracking and Statistics:</strong> Soon, youâ€™ll be able to view resume-based conversion rates and other relevant statistics.</li>
    <li><strong>Accuracy of Job Listings:</strong> Currently, we rely on JobSpy for job scraping, which isn't ideal. I'm developing a new scraper from scratch, aiming for significantly improved search results within two weeks.</li>
